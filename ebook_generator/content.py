A Note from Elie Schulman: The words within this book, like all human expressions, are not claimed to be "true" in any absolute or immutable sense. They represent a perspective, a synthesis of observations, and a framework for understanding, offered with the hope that they spark your own insights and questions.

Elie Schulman is a writer and explorer of human consciousness and emerging technologies, dedicated to understanding how we better articulate our desires in an ever-changing world. His lifelong fascination with language and words has been a constant thread, weaving through diverse experiences that shaped his unique perspective.

In April 2024, Elie had his first significant interaction with ChatGPT. The experience was immediate and profound, an uncanny sensation of "looking in the mirror" â€“ a reflection not just of synthesized knowledge, but of the very structure of human thought and communication. This moment solidified an intuition that AI would fundamentally shift our understanding of ourselves.

Elie's journey through language and communication includes:

- Years of rigorous Talmud study, delving into the nuanced interpretations and precise articulations of ancient texts.
- Years of practicing law, where every word, every phrase, and every question held immense consequence in shaping outcomes.
- Decades of consistent journaling, a private practice of self-prompting and continuous refinement of thought.
- Decades of sitting practice of meditation, cultivating deep awareness of internal states and the subtle interplay of mind and experience.
- Decades immersed in interpersonal process groups, honing the delicate art of expressing needs, hearing others, and navigating complex human dynamics.

These rich experiences fueled an immediate realization upon encountering advanced AI: humanity was on the cusp of at least two profound awakenings. The first, concerning work and economics, signaling a redefinition of labor, value, and societal structures. The second, and perhaps more significantly, relating to human value and spirituality, prompting a deeper inquiry into what truly defines us when machines can mimic so much of our intellect.

Driven by the belief that clear and intentional communication is the bedrock of all progress, Elie wrote "Prompting: Humans Learning How to Ask For What They Want" to empower individuals and organizations to navigate the complexities of the AI era with confidence and precision. His work focuses on demystifying complex concepts and providing practical, actionable insights that can be applied in both professional and personal contexts.

When not writing or researching, Elie enjoys spending time with his family, skiing and tennis."""
