Dr. Evelyn Reed holds a PhD in astrophysics from the California Institute of Technology, specializing in exoplanetary systems and the search for extraterrestrial life.  Her doctoral thesis, "The Probabilistic Distribution of Habitable Zones in Binary Star Systems," garnered significant attention within the scientific community and formed the basis for several peer-reviewed publications in leading journals.  Following her postdoctoral research at the SETI Institute, Dr. Reed transitioned into a role as a senior research scientist at the newly formed Artemis Project, focusing on advanced propulsion systems and interstellar travel.  Her unique blend of theoretical physics and practical engineering experience provides a robust foundation for her insightful exploration of the complex scientific and societal challenges portrayed in her debut novel. Dr. Reed currently resides in Boulder, Colorado, where she continues to contribute to ongoing research while pursuing her passion for science fiction writing.
